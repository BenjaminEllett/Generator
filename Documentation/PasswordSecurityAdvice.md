# Password Security Advice

Here are some suggestions for using passwords securely:

- Always use a different password for each web site, computer, phone, tablet, ATM card, etc.  Never use the same password for more than one web site or device.

- You might not be able to use longer passwords because you cannot enter them correctly, cannot remember them or because they are just too inconvenient.  If this is the case, use the password length which works for you.  You should always use passwords which are at least 8 characters long.

- Here are some recommend password lengths:
     - 6 numbers for PINs (phone lock screen, ATM cards, Yubikeys)
     - 12 characters for web site and computer passwords 
     - If you are willing to use longer passwords, use 22 character passwords for very important passwords.  This includes passwords for your financial accounts, email, Amazon (because it has all of your Kindle books), Microsoft account (software license keys, Xbox games, etc.) and any other account which has a lot of value.  The reason you use these long passwords is they are unguessable.  Shorter passwords are guessable if someone spends enough time and money.

- Always change your password if it has been compromised, leaked or lost.  For example, if you wrote down your password on a piece of paper and lost it, you need to change your password because someone may know it.  Another example is if you enter your password for web site A in web site B.  Web site B (or someone who hacked web site B) now knows your password so you need to change it.

- Do not use any example passwords you see in this program's documentation or in any other documentation.  They are examples of leaked passwords (because they are displayed on a web site and because every visitor knows them).
